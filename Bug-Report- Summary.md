## 💭 Reflection  

Answer briefly (1–2 paragraphs):

- What was your testing approach?  
I manual tested the app on the browser and also viewed the code for any error 
- What did you find easy or difficult during the task?  
- How confident are you now in identifying and reporting bugs? I am still learning an hope to be better software tester as we progress.
